# Geometric Animation in Python

This project implements a simple animated scene using geometric transformations in Python. It includes perspective projection, rotation, translation, and rolling motion for objects in a scene.

## Features
- **Perspective Projection:** Adds depth to the scene.
- **Object Rotation:** Rotates a house around the Y-axis.
- **Translation:** Moves a ball across the scene.
- **Rolling Motion:** Simulates natural rolling of the ball.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
